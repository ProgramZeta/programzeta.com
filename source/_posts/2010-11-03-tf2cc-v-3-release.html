I've uploaded the v.3 release of the Team Fortress 2 Closed Captions. <a href="http://www.programzeta.com/project/team-fortress-2-closed-captions/download/">They're available for download here</a>.

I'll be adding more screenshots and demonstration videos over the next few days to show how it looks, then putting out the word.

Let me know how you like the release by using <a href="http://www.programzeta.com/project/team-fortress-2-closed-captions/feedback/">the brand new Feedback form</a>!
