I plan on making the following changes to the caption files over the next two weeks:
<ol>
	<li>Refresh for Polycount update</li>
	<li>Transfer list of errors/potential errors to new site</li>
	<li>Add option for monochrome view</li>
</ol>
I know I've been dragging on this, so I hope to crank it out over this next week - we'll see what happens!
