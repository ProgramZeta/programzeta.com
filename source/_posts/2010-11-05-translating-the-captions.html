Right now the only language the Team Fortress 2 Closed Captions are in are English, but I'd like to get in touch with translators in order to provide multiple language versions of the subtitles.

If you know both English and non-English language and are willing to translate, please comment here or <a href="http://www.programzeta.com/project/team-fortress-2-closed-captions/feedback/">get in touch with me via the TF2:CC Feedback Form</a>.
