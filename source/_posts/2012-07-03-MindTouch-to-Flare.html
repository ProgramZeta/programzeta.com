<p>It looks like my <a href="https://github.com/ProgramZeta/Mindtouch-to-Flare-Conversion-Tool">MindTouch to Flare conversion tool</a> was featured on <a href="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/blog/2012/07/03/extracting-mindtouch-wiki-content/">MadCap Software's blog</a> today.</p>
<p>I'm happy to answer any questions you have on this script as well as provide guidance on some of the shortcomings of the script. While I haven't had a chance to give this a proper re-write, it should be possible to get your source content moved over. The best way to get in touch is to e-mail me at <a href="mailto:pz+MTtoFlare@programzeta.com">pz+MTtoFlare@programzeta.com</a> and I'll get back to you as I can. Feel free to fork the project on GitHub as well - it'll be interesting to see what changes and improvements the community can make for this tool!</p>
