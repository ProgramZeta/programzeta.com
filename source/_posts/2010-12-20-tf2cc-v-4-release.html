I've gone through and added proper sound effect options for the v.4 release. Don't think there were any other changes.

In order to translate the captions, use these steps:
<ol>
	<li>Make a copy of closecaption_english.txt</li>
	<li>Rename 'english' Â to the language you want to translate to (e.g. 'closecaption_english.txt' becomes 'closecaption_danish.txt')</li>
	<li>Open your new text file and translate from english to your desired language</li>
</ol>
When done, you can either use the source caption compiler to compile the captions, or send the file to me and I will compile and distribute the captions, with credit of course.
