title: Relaunch in Jekyll

So much for one month later. I'm relaunching the site using the admirable <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a> for a few reasons:

<ul>
    <li>I don't want to deal with spam comments anymore - discussion is easily available via social medias or direct through e-mail</li>
    <li>The only dynamic feature I'm using other than comments is the sidebar, which I don't need</li>
    <li>WordPress is kind of a beast, and switching to any static system will give me less moving parts to break / not update / leave vulnerable</li>
</ul>

There are going to be a few odds and ends as the site settles into place, but everything so far looks good.

If you see any missing files or folders, don't hesitate to let me know!
