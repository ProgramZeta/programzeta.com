# The Defense: Season 2 - Group Phase 

Group 2 Match: compLexity Gaming (coL) [0-0] vs. Moscow Five (M5) [0-0]

2012-06-21 20:30 CEST (Central European Standard Time)

## Match Preview

The first match of the Defense features Moscow Five vs. compLexity Gaming in what should be a top-tier match-up.

### compLexity Gaming

The new compLexity Gaming Dota 2 team is an International 2012 invitee as a solid, North American team. Though they have only been picked up by compLexity Gaming this year, team FIRE has been a very competitive in the professional scene, consistently being first or second in the tournaments they've participated in. They'll be looking to establish both themselves and North America as a consistent powerhouse in Dota 2.

### Moscow Five

A Moscow Five team was in the International, but that isn't the same team seen today; an entire roster change has underscored a year of tumultuous change for the team. That is not to say that this 'new' team isn't skilled; they've already been invited to the International 2012, and they qualified but were unable to participate in the DreamHack Summer 2012 Vengeance cup. As the organization's main focus still seems to be towards League of Legends, it's guaranteed that this crew is looking to make Dota 2 a bigger part of the Moscow Five name, and to reclaim the Moscow Five name as a bigger part of the Dota 2 professional scene.
